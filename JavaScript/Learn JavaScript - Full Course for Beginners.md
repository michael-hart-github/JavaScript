## Variables

A variable allows you to store and manipulate data in a dynamic way. It's a label to point to data.

`var`: variable

```
var myName = "Mike";
console.log(myName);
```

You can override the value of a variable with new information.

```
var myName = "Mike";
console.log(myName);
myName = 8;
console.log(myName);
```

## Variable declaration

There are three ways to declare a variable.

1. `var`
2. `let`
3. `const`

`var` is able to be used throughout a program

`let` can only be used within a scope of where it was declared

`const` is unchanging

E.g. Pi will always start with 3.14. It is unchanging
