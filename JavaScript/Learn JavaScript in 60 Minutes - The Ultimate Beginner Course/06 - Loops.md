# Loops
Loops are helpful because they allow a program to repeat an action.
# While loop
The simplest type of loop. The condition between the parenthesis can either be a comparison or a boolean.

```js
while (i < 10) {
	// do something
}
```

```js
while (keyPressed) {
	// do something
}
```

While loops are typically used with a variable named `counter`, but does not have to be.

```js
let counter = 0;
while (counter < 10) {
	console.log("The number is: "+counter);
	counter++;
}
```
# For loop

```js
for (let i =0; i<10; i++) {
	// do something
}
```

# For each loop
Will be covered later.
# Do while loop
Not used very often.
