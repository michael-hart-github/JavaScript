`Comparison operators` let us compare *two* values. An easy way to think about comparison operators is to think of them as "making a statement" or "asking a question".

```js
let name = "Mike";
name == "Tom";
false
```

```js
let valueFive = 5;
console.log(10 == valueFive);
false
```

```js
let loggedIn = true;
console.log(loggedIn != false);
true
```

If a statement is correct, it returns `true`. If a statement is incorrect, it returns `false`.

A comparison will always return a boolean.

Greater than and less than are pretty obvious. If a number is greater than another, or if a number is less than another, it returns information according.

# Equal to operator

The equal to operator checks if two values are the same. It is written with two equal signs

```js
==
```
